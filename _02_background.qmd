# Background

Amazon’s dominance in e-commerce has fundamentally transformed how consumers discover products. With over 2.8 billion monthly visits [@dailyvisits], Amazon’s search algorithm makes billions of ranking decisions that shape consumer behavior and market dynamics. Research demonstrates that top-positioned products receive at least 30% of all clicks, with engagement dropping precipitously for lower positions [@topresult]. Ranking highly on a page is essential to success on the platform.

## Health & Baby Care: A High-Stakes Category

The Health & Baby Care category presents unique challenges that distinguish it from general merchandise. Products directly impacting health and safety make informed decision-making paramount. When consumers are deciding between products, they often rely on product positioning as a signal of quality and effectiveness because they assume the platform’s ranking reflects merit. This trust can stem from the belief that higher-ranked products have been vetted by the platform or validated by large numbers of purchases and positive reviews. This is especially the case in health product categories, where consumers must navigate complex decisions about safety and efficacy with limited technical expertise, potentially making them susceptible to various marketing influences and positioning cues. This reliance becomes problematic when ranking algorithms prioritize commercial factors over consumer welfare.

If Amazon’s results favor products based on profit margins or advertising spend rather than safety or efficacy, it raises ethical questions about platform responsibility. Regulators have begun to take notice. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has increasingly scrutinized how digital platforms present health-related products. In 2020 and 2021, The Bountiful Company (Bountiful) requested to use the “Amazon’s Choice” and “Best Seller” badges from Amazon after disappointing early sales. An insider at the company noted that the product was poorly received by the public, yet sales spiked after they altered its product pages and secured the badges [@ftcdeception]. As of April 2025, the FTC has forced Bountiful to provide return payments to consumers and banned the company from using deceptive review tactics [@ftcaction]. While this action represents progress, it is only a small step toward addressing a much larger problem that demands urgent attention.

Amazon’s business model can create tensions between stakeholder interests because the factors that maximize the platform’s revenue are not always the same as those that best serve consumers or sellers. The company generates revenue through seller fees, sponsored listing advertising, fulfillment services, and sales commissions [@businessmodel]. These diverse revenue streams may incentivize Amazon to give greater visibility to products that contribute more to its bottom line, such as those that purchase ads or use Fulfilled by Amazon, even if those products are not the highest in quality or consumer benefit. This can create friction between commercial priorities and consumer welfare, as well as between sellers who can afford to pay for visibility and those who cannot.

Amazon’s algorithmic placement operates as a “black box.” Consumers cannot easily discern why certain products appear first, which becomes particularly concerning in health categories where high placement may be interpreted as an endorsement to their efficacy. This research attempts to address this gap by providing empirical evidence about product placement factors in a category where transparency matters for public health. It demonstrates methodological approaches for investigating “black box” algorithms using publicly available data while offering practical insights for consumers and sellers navigating Amazon’s marketplace.
