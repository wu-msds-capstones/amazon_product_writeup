# Conclusions

This project set out to answer the main question: What factors influence product ordering in Amazon’s Health & Baby Care search results? By combining exploratory analysis, engineered features, and a suite of predictive models, we found that while some product attributes are loosely associated with placement, such as star ratings, review volume, stock availability, and recent demand, the overall predictability of product order remains limited. This confirms our initial hypothesis that Amazon’s ranking algorithm is a complex “black box,” shaped by more than just product quality or consumer preferences.

These results point to a key insight: Amazon’s product ranking system for Health & Baby Care seems to rely on many hidden factors that we can’t observe directly. While we analyzed visible product features like ratings, reviews, price, and stock status, the low predictive power of our models suggests that other behind-the-scenes signals are driving placement.  These may include advertising spend, whether a product is fulfilled by Amazon (e.g., through the Fulfillment by Amazon program indicated by a Prime badge), or proprietary engagement metrics that Amazon does not make public. While some of these indicators, such as fulfillment status, can occasionally be inferred from product pages, they are not consistently structured in the HTML and therefore were not systematically captured in our dataset.  This makes it difficult to fully understand how products are ranked, especially in a category where consumer trust and safety are critical.

Despite these challenges, our project demonstrates a practical way to study opaque ranking systems. By scraping publicly available data, carefully engineering features, and applying interpretable machine learning models, we were able to identify patterns, even if they weren’t strong enough to make highly accurate predictions. Importantly, we did find consistent signals that align with commercial popularity, such as product engagement and prior sales volume, reinforcing the idea that visibility is influenced by factors beyond just product quality.

This work also lays the groundwork for future research. One promising direction is to collect more types of data, like whether a product is sponsored, what keywords it ranks for, or how users interact with it. For Health & Baby Care in particular, incorporating independent measures of a product’s clinical effectiveness or safety, which are drawn from regulatory approvals, lab testing, or peer-reviewed studies, would allow for a focused, critical comparison between actual health benefits and the factors driving visibility. These additional features could improve model performance and help reveal whether the ranking algorithm aligns with consumer welfare.. Another path involves studying Amazon’s seller tools and advertising programs to better understand how sellers influence their own visibility.

In short, we didn’t crack the full code of Amazon’s algorithm, but we took a meaningful step toward understanding it. Our results show that while public data can offer important clues, full transparency is still lacking in product categories where rankings can affect real health decisions. If platforms like Amazon want to earn consumer trust, clearer explanations of how rankings are determined will be essential.
