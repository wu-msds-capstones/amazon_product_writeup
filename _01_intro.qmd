# Introduction

In the digital marketplace, visibility is currency. When consumers search for health and baby care products on Amazon, the order in which products appear can dramatically influence purchasing decisions, shape how a brand is perceived, and ultimately affect consumer welfare. High placement can create a perception of greater credibility, quality, or popularity-regardless of a product’s actual merits-while lower placement can limit a brand’s market reach. Also, in health-related categories, this can have direct implications for consumer welfare, as ranking can guide choices toward or away from products that impact safety and effectiveness. This project investigates the fundamental question: *What factors influence the ordering of product search results on Amazon’s site within the Health & Baby Care categories, and to what extent do those factors align with consumer interests and product quality?*

The positioning of products in search results represents a complex intersection of commercial interests and consumer behavior. Products that secure top positions have a tendency to receive disproportionate attention because many consumers focus on what they see first and might not scroll through all available options. This leads to increased traffic, higher conversion rates, and enhanced perceived credibility among consumers. This phenomenon, known as the “position bias effect,” has been extensively documented in search engine research and e-commerce studies such as eBay or ManoMano.fr, where users demonstrate a strong tendency to click on results appearing higher in the list, regardless of their objective quality or relevance [@manomanopositionbias; @kdnuggetspositionbias; @ecommercepositionbias].

Our research focuses specifically on Amazon’s Health & Baby Care categories, where product placement decisions carry heightened significance. Unlike general merchandise, health-related products directly impact consumer well-being, making the transparency and fairness of ranking algorithms a matter of public interest and health. When parents search for baby formula or adults seek dietary supplements, the products they encounter first may influence decisions that affect their family’s health and safety.

This investigation serves multiple stakeholders. For sellers, understanding the mechanics of product visibility provides strategic insights for optimizing their market presence through pricing, branding, and promotional strategies. For consumers, revealing the factors behind product ordering enables more informed purchasing decisions by understanding whether top-ranked products earn their position through merit or algorithmic preferences.
